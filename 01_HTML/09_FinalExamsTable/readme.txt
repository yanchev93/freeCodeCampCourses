Step 1
In this workshop, you will practice working with HTML tables by building a final exam table for a group of students.

To begin the project, add the <!DOCTYPE html>, and an html element with a lang attribute of en.

Inside the html element, add a head element.
---------
Step 2
Inside your head element, nest a meta element with the charset attribute set to the value "UTF-8".

Below that meta element, add a title element.

The title element's text should be Calculus Final Exams Table.

After you complete your head element, you can add your body element.
---------
Step 3
In the previous lectures, you learned how to work with the table element to represent tabular data.

Inside your body element, nest a table element.
---------
Step 4
To add a caption to a table, you can use the table caption element.

Here is an example using the caption element:

Example Code
<table>
  <caption>Football Scores</caption>
</table>
Inside your table element, nest a caption element with the text Calculus Final Exam Grades.
---------
Step 5
For the first section of the table, you will want to group the header content which represents the column labels for the student's first name, last name, and final exam grade.

The table head element, thead, is used to group the header content in a table.

Here is an example using the thead element:

Example Code
<table>
  <thead>
    <!-- header content goes here -->
  </thead>
</table>
Below your caption element, add a table head element.
---------
Step 6
The table head element consists of a table row element, tr, which contains the table header cell elements, th.

Here is an example using the tr and th elements for a sports table:

Example Code
<table>
  <caption>Football Scores</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Team</th>
      <th>Wins</th>
      <th>Losses</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
</table>
Inside your thead element, add a tr element.

Inside your tr element, add three th elements.

The first th element should contain the text Last Name. The second th element should contain the text First Name. The third th element should contain the text Grade.
---------
Step 7
Now that you have completed the head section, it is time to add the table body, tbody. The table body will represent all of the student names and their grades.

Add a table body element to your table.
---------
Step 8
To add student data to the table, you will need to use the table row and table data elements.

The table data element, td, is used to create a cell in the table.

Here is an example of using the td element for a sports players table:

Example Code
<tr>
  <td>1</td>
  <td>John Doe</td>
  <td>USA</td>
</tr>
Inside your table body element, add a table row element, tr, with three table data elements, td.

The first table data element should contain the last name of Davis.

The second table data element should contain the first name of Alex.

The third table data element should contain the grade of 54.
---------
Step 9
Now it is time to add two more students to the table.

Following the same pattern as the previous step, add a second student table row. Use the following data for the table data elements:

Last Name: Doe
First Name: Samantha
Grade: 92
For the third student table row, use the following data for the table data elements:

Last Name: Rodriguez
First Name: Marcus
Grade: 88
---------
Step 10
Now it is time to add two more students to the table.

Following the same pattern as the previous steps, add a fourth student table row. Use the following data for the table data elements:

Last Name: Thompson
First Name: Jane
Grade: 77
For the fifth student table row, use the following data for the table data elements:

Last Name: Williams
First Name: Natalie
Grade: 83
---------
Step 11
The last section to add to the table would be the table foot element, tfoot. The table foot element will be used to display the average grade for all of the students in the table.

Add a tfoot element to the table.

Inside the tfoot element, add a tr element.

Inside the tr element, add two td elements.

The first td element should contain the text Average Grade. The second td element should contain the text 78.8.
---------
Step 12
Your table is almost complete but there is one last thing to add.

It would be nice if the td element used for the Average Grade would span across two columns instead of just one.

To do this, you can use the colspan attribute on the td element.

The colspan attribute specifies the number of columns a cell should span.

Here is an example of using the colspan attribute for a sports table:

Example Code
<tr>
  <td colspan="3">Total Points</td>
</tr>
Inside the opening td tag, add the colspan attribute and set it to "2".

And with that change, your table is complete!
